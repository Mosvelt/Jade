# Jade
Jade is a python based, open source coding language that is currently in early development. We intend to have it be a collaborative project through the use of custom made libraries shared between coders and teams.

The reason for Jade is simple. We saw python and wanted to stretch its limits, so we abused its mechanics and intend to make is faster, lighter to handle on all systems, C Module compatible, optimised and most importantly, open source using a conceptual library folder accessable through the IDE itself. This allows coders to develop their own libraries, optimised for their personal use and upload them to this repository.

Jade is still in it's early stages, but we hope to get it out to everyone soon. 

We hope you enjoy our site into the future of coding,

Project Jade.
